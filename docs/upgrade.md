### Guidelines to upgrade to the latest DirectPV version

DirectPV version upgrades are seameless and transparent. The resources will be upgraded automatically when you run the latest version over the existing resources. The latest version of DirectPV should be available in [krew](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew-index). For more details on the installation, Please refer the [Installation guidelines](./installation.md).

The following recording demonstrates the version upgrade path.
