### Guidelines to upgrade to the latest DirectCSI version

DirectCSI version upgrades are seameless and transparent. The resources will be upgraded automatically when you run the latest version over the existing resources. The latest version of DirectCSI should be available in [krew](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew-index). For more details on the installation, Please refer the [Installation guidelines](./installation.md).

The following recording demonstrates the version upgrade path.
